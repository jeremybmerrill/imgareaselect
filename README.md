imgAreaSelect: The Multi-Select Fork
====================================

This is a fork of odyniec's [imgAreaSelect](http://odyniec.net/projects/imgareaselect/) that allows for multiple selections to be made on the same document.

Jeremy B. Merrill made these modifications for use in [Tabula](http://github.com/jazzido/tabula), a tool for liberating tabular data from PDFs.

Pull requests are happily accepted; this project is under development as of April 2013.

N.B. unlike odyniec's original version, this depends on [underscore.js](http://www.underscorejs.org).
